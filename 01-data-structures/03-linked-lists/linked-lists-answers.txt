What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

    Its quite literal in actually looking for where in the memory something is located.. chache vs RAM for example.  Items in cache are much faster to access than
    items stored in the RAM.  So limiting time accessing RAM to load items into Cache leads to performance increase.

Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.

    Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
        
        Array       = 0.000026 sec
        Linked List = 0.002525 sec

        Linked List is over 97% slower

    Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.

        Array       = 0.000005 sec
        Linked List = 0.000352 sec

        Linkd List is 70%ish times slower

    Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
    In the Array, the 5001st item becomes the 5000th, and so on.

        Array       = 0.000010 sec
        Linked List = 0.000353 sec

        Linked list is 35%ish times slower
