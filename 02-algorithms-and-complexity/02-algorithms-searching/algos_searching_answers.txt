Given Collection [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]
1) Linear Search G would require 7 iterations
2) Binary Search G would require 3 iterations

Calculate by Hand
Fib(10) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
Fib(11) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
Fib(12) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Benchmark recursive vs iterative Fibonacci()

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, I would use a linear search.  Binary searches require a sorted collection.  I would use an iterative search for speed.
